# hello-world
A living e-notebook of randomness

Hello World! Hello World? Hello World. My name is Alaisha and I'm a freshman at Harvard College (nope, not anymore, I'm getting terribly more post-grad by the day). I love accidental street art, ballet, edamame beans, and tasteful apps. This is all still true, but I have no shame in saying I prefer ideating apps that some chained LLM will build than building them myself.

P.S. I am actually a porpoise. Did you know they have [pink cousins](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/amazon-river-dolphin)? Who are badly endangered ): show some love [here](https://ardcf.org/).

P.P.S. I think I was supposed to add to this over the years, but honestly digital fragmentation is the new black and I really can't be bothered to allocate bandwidth to yet another e-notebook. I have too many already. If for God knows what reason you're interested, [my website](alaisharma.com) is your best bet.
